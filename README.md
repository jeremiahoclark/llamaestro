<H3>Why Llamaestro? </H3>

Llamaestro is built on top of Maestro. It provides users the following benefits:

1. Cheaper 🤑 - Maestro was uh... pricey (Opus is a baller 💸; LLama3 is a penny pincher)
2. Easier to run 🏃‍♂️ - don't have to manage packages
3. Faster 🚀 - Llamaestro utilizes Groq API and is so fast I had to build in a sleep timer to prevent hitting rate limits.
4. User-friendlier 🙈 - You don't have to look at code

<br></br>

<H3>How to Use</H3>
*In 5 incredibly hard steps*

1. Go to the GroqCloud dashboard and create a new API key.
2. Copy this  Google Colab notebook.
3. Click the the "Secrets" (key icon) on the left sidebar and click "Add secret".
4. Enter a name for your secret: "GROQ_API_KEY" and paste your GroqCloud API key as the value.
5. Click Runtime in the top navigation bar and click "Run All" or just hit cmd+enter a few times

<H3>Additional context</H3>
*Yes, this is autogenerated*

Maestro is a multi-agent framework designed to break down complex objectives into smaller sub-tasks and coordinate the execution of these sub-tasks using different AI agents. The framework consists of three main components:

<br></br>

Llamaestro (Llama 3): The primary AI agent responsible for decomposing the objective into smaller sub-tasks and coordinating the overall workflow.
Little Llama: An AI agent that handles the execution of individual sub-tasks generated by Llamaestro.
Big Llama: An AI agent that reviews and refines the results produced by Little Llama to ensure the final output meets the original objective.

<br></br>

The Maestro framework is particularly useful for tackling complex, multi-step objectives that require a systematic approach and the coordination of multiple AI agents.

<br></br>

<H3>Example Objectives</H3>
The Maestro framework is particularly helpful for solving objectives that involve multiple steps, require the coordination of different AI agents, or need to adapt to changing requirements. Some example objectives where this multi-agent framework can be beneficial include:

<br></br>
- Research & Summaries
- Coding small to medium apps
- Writing a book
